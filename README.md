# Roastery: Zayleigh's Static Site

Welcome to my corner of the internet! My name is Zayleigh, and I'm a coder, coffee addict, and all-around sassy person. This static site is my personal space to share my thoughts, experiences, and projects with the world.

As a developer, I'm always tinkering with new technologies and exploring different ways to express my creativity. On this site, you'll find a mix of technical and personal content, ranging from tutorials and code snippets to musings on life and coffee.

So grab a cup of your favorite brew and make yourself at home. Feel free to browse through my posts, leave comments, and reach out if you want to chat. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your stay!
